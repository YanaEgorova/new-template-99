                <p class="text">In consideration of the Services you provide and the rights you grant to <span class="js_website-name" style="font-family:inherit; font-size: inherit; color: inherit"></span> with respect to the Content, as further provided herein, you will be entitled to the following:</p>
                <p class="text"><span style="color: #cd7f32">Bronze Level Brand Ambassador:</span> if you generate between 0-25 monthly sales in the previous month, you will be entitled to provide 10% off to your followers AND receive 10% commissions on all net sales by third parties generated using your unique promo link or promo code (the “Promo Code”).</p>
                <p class="text"><span style="color: #c0c0c0">Silver Level Brand Ambassador:</span> if you generate between 26-75 monthly sales in the previous month, you will be entitled to provide 10% off to your followers AND receive 12% commissions on all net sales by third parties generated using your unique Promo Code.</p>

                 The tiered commissions above are based on the previous month’s sales.
                 </p>
                <p class="text">Commissions may be paid out upon request, as long as your commissions earned are at least ten dollars ($10) (in other words, your commission may be paid out as soon as it reaches $10). You may request payout of your commission no more than once daily. Commissions paid on a daily basis will be based on the previous day’s sales. Commissions will not be paid based on any sales or amounts for any returned Product or any orders that <span class="js_website-name" style="font-family:inherit; font-size: inherit; color: inherit"></span>, in its sole discretion, determines to be attributed to spam, credit card fraud, unauthorized use of your Promo Code, unauthorized use of <span class="js_website-name" style="font-family:inherit; font-size: inherit; color: inherit"></span>’s trademarks, copyrights, logos or other intellectual property, or use of any unauthorized claims. If a sale is canceled or refunded for any reason, any paid commission will be deducted from the amount <span class="js_website-name" style="font-family:inherit; font-size: inherit; color: inherit"></span> owes to you and any subsequent payout of your commissions. Commissions are counted and final numbers are deemed final at the sole discretion and decision of <span class="js_website-name" style="font-family:inherit; font-size: inherit; color: inherit"></span>. <span class="js_website-name" style="font-family:inherit; font-size: inherit; color: inherit"></span> also reserves the right to change the frequency and dates of your commission payouts.</p>
                <p class="text">You should clearly advise your followers/customers to use your Promo Code to purchase <span class="js_website-name" style="font-family:inherit; font-size: inherit; color: inherit"></span> Products in order for you to receive commissions. While <span class="js_website-name" style="font-family:inherit; font-size: inherit; color: inherit"></span> makes every reasonable effort to accurately track and pay commissions for all Ambassador sales, <span class="js_website-name" style="font-family:inherit; font-size: inherit; color: inherit"></span> is not responsible for and will not be held liable for any technical difficulties, outside events, actions by other ambassadors, or other uncontrollable events that may disrupt or interfere with <span class="js_website-name" style="font-family:inherit; font-size: inherit; color: inherit"></span>’s ability to track sales or pay commissions. <span class="js_website-name" style="font-family:inherit; font-size: inherit; color: inherit"></span> has the right to pay commissions to any other person, in its sole discretion.</p>
                <p class="text">You are solely responsible for any and all tax obligations, if any, due to any taxing authorities arising from or in connection with commissions paid to you by <span class="js_website-name" style="font-family:inherit; font-size: inherit; color: inherit"></span> in connection with the Program. <span class="js_website-name" style="font-family:inherit; font-size: inherit; color: inherit"></span> reserves the right to withhold payment pending an investigation of suspected fraud or misrepresentation of associated commissions for orders or referrals that were obtained fraudulently or through misrepresentation.</p>
                <p class="text"><span class="js_website-name" style="font-family:inherit; font-size: inherit; color: inherit"></span> will make commercially reasonable efforts to allow you to track your commissions and payout via the <span class="js_website-name" style="font-family:inherit; font-size: inherit; color: inherit"></span> partners dashboard.</p>
